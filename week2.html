    <div>In his A History of the <strong>World War</strong> (page 212), Captain Liddell Hart reports that <em>a planned offensive</em> by thirteen British divisions, <strong>supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, <em>against the German line at Serre-Montauban,</em> scheduled for July 24, 1916,</strong> had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - which lacked any special significance. The following deposition, <em>dictated by, read over, and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, <strong>former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule,</strong></em> casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are missing. </div>
